element always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the
full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). A
block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element
does not. Inline elements An inline element does not start on a new line. An
inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a
<span>
    element inside a paragraph.
